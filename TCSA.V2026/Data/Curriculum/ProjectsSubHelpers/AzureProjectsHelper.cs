These technologies have spread very fast amongst big companies since the mid-2000s and now they’re ubiquitous in organizations of all sizes. That means experience with cloud-computing is a requirement in the majority of programming jobs ads. The biggest player in cloud-computing is AWS (from Amazon), with 32% of market share (as of 2020), against Azure’s 20%. And it’s totally ok to choose AWS as your cloud-provider, but we’re sticking to Azure since it’s Microsoft’s solution and it integrates seamlessly with .NET’s tools."
